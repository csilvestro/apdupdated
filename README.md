# APD Updated - March Term

We will be practicing the basics of JavaScript and Github. Feel free to push, pull, merge and fetch the information.  


**Practice**
1. Create a variable called bucketlist.
2. The bucketlist variable should contain an object. This object should have five places that you would like to travel. (Keys: City/State, Country)
```
const bucketList = {[
    citystate: 'Someplace',
    country: 'USA'
]}
```
3. Display your bucket list in an html file.
4. Push your files to this branch.
5. Have fun!
